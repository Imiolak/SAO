## 1. Problem definition

### 1.1. Reversi rules
Reversi is a two-player strategy board game played with pieces (or disks), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Each player has one color assigned to him. The goal of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the game ends. Reversi rules are as follows:
* game is played on a 8x8 board
* game starts with two light and two dark pieces on board, positioned in the center, see image below:

* dark player is the first to move
* during player's turn, the player places a piece on the board, his colour up. A piece must be placed on a square adjacent to opposing player's piece in such a way, that at least one opposing piece is captured
* capture occurs when there is a straight line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) between a piece that is being placed on the board and any other piece owned by the acting player, with at least one opposing player's piece in between. The pieces in beetween are turned over
* game ends when the player to act has no available moves to make, whoever has the majority of pieces in his colour wins
